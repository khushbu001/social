//1) Given arrival and departure times of all trains that reach a railway station, the task is to find the
//minimum number of platforms required for the railway station so that no train waits.
//We are given two arrays which represent arrival and departure times of trains that stop.
//Example Input & Output:
//Input: arr[] = {9:00, 9:40, 9:50, 11:00, 15:00, 18:00}
//dep[] = {9:10, 12:00, 11:20, 11:30, 19:00, 20:00}
//Output: 3
